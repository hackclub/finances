# Ledger

The one and only home of Hack Club's finances. And when we say finances, we mean _everything_. Transaction by transaction.

If you have Docker on your machine, you can run `./bin/bash` to be dropped into a Docker container's shell with [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) installed. You can then run all sorts of neat reports, like `ledger -f main.ledger bal`.

Have at it! (and contributions are welcome!)
